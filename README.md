# Lectures of 3-1 CSE '15 in Latex
---
### Introduction
  This repository was created for the collaborative creation of class lectures in LateX. 
Courses are arranged in folders, and the pdfs are compiled. There is a plan in future to create a supporting website to feature all of this work.
For now, the motivation for making this open source project is to learn collaborative work with git, and LateX at the same time making useful content for us, and future batches

##### Please read the contributing guidlines for developing further. These guidelines are there to ensure everyone follows the same set of standards during development
